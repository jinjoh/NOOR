*********************************************************************
*********************************************************************

There are three build systems for unixy platforms, the old NaN Makefiles 
and the brand new SCons-based system and CMake.

The NaN system is best understood, if you want to use the configure system,
please help improve it. SCons has been added as a new build system for
Blender and it has expanded in a short time, proving to be a quite handy
build system.

*********************************************************************
*********************************************************************



--------------Basic Makefile TIPS---------------------------------------


First of all, make sure 
1) you have the full source tree available, either via SVN or as source download. 
2) you have the libs dir (SVNROOT/lib/ or bf-blender/lib/ ) checkout as well

Read about that here;
http://www.blender3d.org/cms/Building_Blender.117.0.html

In bf-blender/blender/source you can find several .mk files, these are the
main makefile templates, used all over the Makefiles in the source tree.

Edit source/nan_definitions.mk to fit your environment, be sure to edit the
block matching your OS. You will want to change variables like 
NAN_JPEG, NAN_PNG, NAN_PYTHON etc. to point to where you have those installed.

Also check on source/Makefile, for potential conflicts with how you configured
your system. In general this is not needed though.

If you want to be able to run in 'make' in any subdirectory, you also need to
set 2 environment variables;

NANBLENDERHOME : should point to the bf-blender directory
MAKEFLAGS: "-w -I$NANBLENDERHOME/source"

After adjusting things for your environment you can run 'make' (or use the nice hmake
script at blender/source/tools/hmake/hmake).

1) run 'make' in bf-blender/intern/
2) run 'make' in bf-blender/extern/
3) run 'make' in bf-blender/source/

The last step should result in the blender binary. But, first check the TIPS below 
for the specific OS's.

NOTE 1:
It is possible that compiling fails because a directory to save objects and libs to was
never created before. These all go to bf-blender/obj/xxxxx/ , where xxxx stands for the
'guessconfig' name of your OS/CPU configuration.
You can run 'guessconfig' here: bf-blender/source/tools/guess/guessconfig

NOTE 2:
That same 'guessconfig' name is used to read from bf-blender/lib/
Since that directory comes from svn, easiest is to create a symlink to that dir with the
correct name.




----------------------Basic SCons TIPS----------------------------------

More documentation on the scons system is available at
blender/doc/blender-scons.txt and blender/doc/blender-scons-dev.txt.  Where
this document and those conflict, those are much more likely to be right.

To be able to build with the SCons build system you'll need Python (preferably
version 2.4.x) and SCons (http://www.scons.org) installed. After you're
sure these work properly you are ready to build with SCons.

Systems supported at the moment are:
* Linux (Ken )
* Windows (jesterKing)
* Irix (Hos)
* Cygwin (Michel_)
* MacOS (sgefant)

All except Linux build with this system against the precompiled libraries,
so be sure to get them from SVN, ie. for Windows:

svn co https://svn.blender.org/svnroot/bf-blender/trunk/lib/windows

Be sure to do this at the same level your blender directory is at
(ie. /home/username/build/blender and /home/username/build/lib/OS).

Not all are entirely complete yet, but the system itself is very usable.

Quick tip 1: type 'scons' to build it.   (If you get errors edit config.opts
	so that it matches your system)
Quick tip 2: type 'scons clean' to clean your build tree.
Quick tip 3: You should also remove/rename user_config.py any time SConstruct
	has changed.

The main file of interest is the SConstruct file in the blender 
directory. Open this file and browse to the section that concerns your
system. Set any options as necessary (the true/false switches, the
rest should work out-of-the-box).

When you're satisfied with the settings you should run scons. For most systems
that is just in the command-line in the directory containing the SConstruct
file. If you want to, you can use the switch -j N for benefiting more processors,
and --debug=time for timing the entire build process.

If you are on Windows and you want to compile with MSVC (6 and 7) you'll need
to run vcvars32.bat in your command-line (DOS-box) to set the necessary
environment variables. Be sure to browse to the blender top-directory. Type
'scons' and watch the build fly by.

For the Windows build the QuickTime SDK is expected to be at
lib\windows\QTDevWin\CIncludes
and
lib\windows\QTDevWin\Libraries,
but you can alter the SConstruct file to point it to the path you have your
QuickTime SDK installed.


----------------------WINDOWS TIPS--------------------------------------

When building Blender on Windows you have three choices:
METHOD 1. Build using the old NaN Makefiles.
METHOD 2. Use Microsoft Visual Studio project files (msvc6 and msvc7)
METHOD 3. Use SCons (see above)

These directions are for method 2. Method 1 was used in Nan in combination 
with Cygwin.

If you are using Method 1 with cygwin you need to set FREE_WINDOWS 
to true you can do this with: export FREE_WINDOWS=true

EXTERNAL LIBARIES
All external libraries that Blender depends on are found in SVN in 
precompiled form. If you did not already do so, check out lib/windows from SVN using
 
svn co https://svn.blender.org/svnroot/bf-blender/trunk/lib/windows

[NOTE: Make sure you are in the directory where the blender directory resides,
NOT in the blender directory itself! lib/windows must be in the same dir as
blender to make the VC project files work correctly.]
If you prefer to build or download those libraries yourself, there are some
directions below.

INTERN LIBRARIES:
The first thing you need to do is to build the Blender "intern" libraries.
You need to have Python installed on your machine.

Open the workspace in the $NANBLENDERHOME/intern/make/msvc_6_0 (msvc_7_0 if you
want to build with .NET) directory.
Build the "build_install_all" project. This will build all the intern libraries
and installs them in the $NANBLENDERHOME/../lib/windows directory.

If you get weird compiler errors, make sure you have the latest Visual Studio
Service Pack installed. SP5 worked for me.

If the post build step (copying the libraries to their destinations) fails,
this is probably due to the fact that MSVC can't find the XCOPY command as 
happened to me on an XP system. MSVC has it's own PATH that you can set through
the options. Open options from the menu: Tools->Options. Go to the directories
tab and select "Executable files" from the drop down menu. Now add you SYSTEM32
directory.

The last project build is the python_freeze project that will freeze python code
for compilation and linking with Blender's C code. At the moment, this should be
automatic except that batch file probably does not find Python. If this is the
case, follow the same procedure as was mentioned above for the XCOPY command
to add Python to your path.

BUILDING BLENDER

Open the workspace $NANBLENDERHOME/projectfiles/blender/blender.dsw or the
solution $NANBLENDERHOME/projectfiles_vc7/blender/blender.sln

blender           Builds the main executable

Choose the project blender and hit F7. If all is well it should build
with a lot of warnings but no errors.

BUILDING/DOWNLOADING EXTERNAL LIBRARIES
If you don't want to use the precompiled libraries you can download and/or
build them yourself. Here are some directions.

JPEG:
BINARY LIBRARY:
Go to sourceforge.net, navigate to the GnuWin32 project and download 
libjpeg-6b-lib.zip. Rename the unzipped directory "jpeg" and copy it to the 
$NANBLENDERHOME/../lib/windows directory.
FROM SOURCES:
Download the jpeg sources from http://www.ijg.org/. Go into the source 
directory and copy the file jconfig.vc to jconfig.h. Now start a command box
and run nmake /f makefile.vc (assuming nmake is in your path, if not run the
vcvars32.bat batch file located in the VC98/Bin directory of the MSVC 
installation directory first).
Copy these include files: jconfig.h, jerror.h, jmorecfg.h, jpeglib.h
from the build directory to the lib tree in this directory:
$NANBLENDERHOME/../lib/windows/jpeg/include
The file libjpeg.lib should be copied to:
$NANBLENDERHOME/../lib/windows/jpeg/lib

PNG:
Go to sourceforge.net, navigate to the GnuWin32 project and download 
libpng-1.2.4-1-lib.zip. Rename the unzipped directory "png" and copy it to the 
$NANBLENDERHOME/../lib/windows directory.

ZLIB:
Go to sourceforge.net, navigate to the GnuWin32 project and download 
zlib-1.1.4-lib.zip. Rename the unzipped directory "zlib" and copy it to the 
$NANBLENDERHOME/../lib/windows directory.

QUICKTIME:
The blender.sln expects the Quicktime SDK to be in lib/windows/QTDevWin, which
should contain the directories CIncludes and Libraries.



----------------------Mac OSX TIPS--------------------------------------

When building Blender on OSX you have two choices:
METHOD 1. Build using the old NaN Makefiles.
METHOD 2. Use the SCons build system (see above)

Step1:
If you want to follow method 1, follow the "Basic Makefile TIPS" above to set the
environment variables. You don't need to edit the Makefiles. They should work
out of the box in combinations with some external libraries that should be on
your system in a fixed location. 

Step 2:
You can use the package installer fink (http://fink.sourceforge.net/) for some
of the external libraries:
1. jpeg    (fink install libjpeg)
2. png     (fink install libpng3)
4. python23 ((adds the static lib for python) fink install python23)
	You will probably want to select python-nox when
	it asks you. (Also read python note below)
5. freetype (fink install freetype2)


If you use OSX 10.3, the python framework is part of the OS installation, so you
don't have to use the fink installer for it. The Makefile is configured for 10.3
by default, so for 10.2 you have to open source/nan_definitions.mk and comment out:
	export PY_FRAMEWORK	= 1    

Step 3:
The rest of the external libraries are present in SVN in binary format so you
don't have to download them. Precompiled libraries are found in SVN in 
directory:
$NANBLENDERHOME/lib/darwin-6.1-powerpc
If you are not running on a darwing kernel 6.1 (which is likely if you auto-
update your system, you might want to add a symbolic link in the 
$NANBLENDERHOME/lib/ directory. For example, if you work on a 6.2 kernel:
ln -s darwin-6.1-powerpc darwin-6.2-powerpc

Step 4: 
Start the build process by building Blender's "intern" libraries. Navigate to 
$NANBLENDERHOME/intern and type make. This will build the intern libraries which
will be installed into the $NANBLENDERHOME/lib/darwin-6.1-powerpc (thanks to 
the symbolic link).
Do the same for the $NANBLENDERHOME/extern directory

Step 5 
Navigate to $NANBLENDERHOME/source and type make. 

Step 6:
Although the Makefiles in the intern directory run ranlib on the libraries 
built, the gcc linker complains about ranlib not being run. Until there is a
solution, you will need to run ranlib by hand once in a while when the make 
breaks. Luckily, the error message lists the full path of the file to run 
ranlib on... so just type "ranlib */*.a" or so. :)


BUILDING EXTERNAL LIBRARIES
If you don't want to use the precompiled libraries you can download and/or
build them yourself. Here are some directions.


FREETYPE
- the freetype lib in /usr/X11R6 installed by apple X11 SDK dont work in blender (not the standard lib)
- both those installed by fink and darwinports can work, or you can compile your own. in any case, 
dont move these libs from their install location or you will break other libs (like fgtl) that rely on them. 

* if you must move them, edit freetype-config and adjust prefix variable (3rd line). 
* always keep freetype-config in the bin directory of the new location
* for blender, safer to set enable_shared=no
* to build easily those unix libs create a symbolic link as follow :
            sudo ln -s /System/Library/Frameworks/OpenGL.framework/Versions/A/Headers /usr/include/GL
* build the unix version, not the mac one
* use ./configure then make and make install
* the SVN version of freetype-config has the path on my computer, adjust it to yours if you want to rebuild fgtl


----------------------NetBSD TIPS--------------------------------------
NetBSD (and other platforms using pkgsrc)

Quick Install

cd /usr/pkgsrc/graphics/blender
make install

In-depth Instructions

NetBSD's Packages Collection provides for easy installation from 
source on a multitude of platforms (NetBSD, Linux, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, 
Darwin, IRIX).  You should be able to compile and install Blender 
easily by simply changing into the directory 
/usr/pkgsrc/graphics/blender and issuing the command 'make install'.  
This will automatically download the sources, verify their integrity, 
download and install all necessary dependencies and build and install 
Blender.  Please see for details:
	http://www.netbsd.org/Documentation/software/packages.html
	http://www.netbsd.org/Documentation/pkgsrc/


Note that there are a few flags you can set to compile in support for 
additional packages.  Search /usr/pkgsrc/mk/bsd.pkg.defaults.mk for 
"BLENDER" variables and set them according to your preference in 
/etc/mk.conf

If you experience problems building the package, please use send-pr(1)

on your NetBSD system or submit a problem report via:
 http://www.netbsd.org/cgi-bin/sendpr.cgi?gndb=netbsd
